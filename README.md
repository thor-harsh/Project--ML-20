**In this project we have applied PCA(Principal Component Analysis on Wine Quality Dataset to get the best 3 principal components and plot a 3d plot of that.**

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular technique for analyzing large datasets containing a high number of dimensions/features per observation, increasing the interpretability of data while preserving the maximum amount of information, and enabling the visualization of multidimensional data.


**Steps**:<br></br>

1.Reading the csv file as DataFrame
2.Filtering out Target Variables/Dependent Variables and Independent Variables
3. Standard Scaling
4. Splitting the data into training and testing set
5. Making a 3d plot
